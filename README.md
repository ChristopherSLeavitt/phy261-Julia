# phy261-Julia
## First run of course using Julia (instead of Python)
This repository contains materials for Computational Physics (phy261)
at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, Maine. 
This course is required in the second semester for all physics majors,
as we are incorporating computation into all of our upper level courses.

# phy261-Julia
## First run of course using Julia (instead of Python)
This repository contains materials for Computational Physics (phy261)
at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, Maine. 

This course is required in the second semester for all physics majors, this way,
students will be prepared for our upper level courses into which we are incorporating
computation throughout the curriculum so that students graduate with much more computational
fluency than if they simply had a semester of computing. 

Initially, this project of creating problem set questions for our upper level courses
was going to use python and Julia (as an option). However, when using Julia, it quickly became the preferable language because of its ability to use unicode characters as variable names, its built in vectorization capabilities, and its increased speed relative to python.

So, for the first time, we are dropping python in our computational physics course, and using Julia.
